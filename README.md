# Fake_Information_Detection
This project detects fake news using NLP and machine learning. It preprocesses text with TF-IDF vectorization and compares models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes. A Streamlit app provides real-time predictions. Models are saved with Joblib for deployment.
